# Math Problems

This is a place to put various math problems that I find. One of my goals is to solve as many as possible with a computer program. Language of choice currently is Haskell. I want to learn a functional programming language and Haskell seems a good choice. Especially since I've been reading *The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming* by Kees Doets and Jan van Eijck. 

After taking *Introduction to Programming with MATLAB* from Vanderbilt on Coursera, solving problems with MATLAB (or Octave) has become a preferred option.
